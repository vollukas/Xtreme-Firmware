This firmware is a complete overhaul of the [Official Firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware), and also features lots of awesome code-bits from [Unleashed](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware).

-----
<br>
<h2 align="center">What makes it special?</h2>

We have spent many hours perfecting this code even further, and getting the most out of it.

The goal of this Firmware is to regularly bring out amazing updates based on what the community wants, with an actual understanding of whats going on. Fixing bugs that are regularly talked about, removing unstable / broken applications (.FAP) and actually using the level system that just sits abandoned everywhere else.
<br><br>
- <h4>Feature-rich: We include all commonly found apps in the firmware, as long as they work.</h4>

- <h4>Stable: Many hours have been spent rewriting core parts of the Flippers firmware as well as some of its apps to ensure stability. A task that was long needed on all Firmware, so we tackled it right away.</h4>

- <h4>Customizable: Dont like the Animations, want to turn on/off the Home screen icons (battery, SD card etc), change the flippers name or anything like that? You absolutely can. No need to mess with code or deal with weird manifest files. Its all done with an App.</h4>
<br><br>
Note, the below mentioned changes are only a few things we did. For a full list click [here](https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware/wiki/Customization)

<h2 align="center">Xtreme Settings:</h2>

We wrote a powerful yet easy-to-use application specifically for our Firmware, that gives you easy-access to all the fancy things we implemented:

This image needs to be updated!
Also, perhaps a bigger height, with set width (yes distrotion issues ik) so it fits all our bulletpoints without issues

- <ins><b>Interface:</b></ins> Customize every bit of your Flipper, from the desktop animations, to the main menu apps, lockscreen style etc.

- <ins><b>Protocols:</b></ins> Here you can toggle between USB & Bluetooth mode for <a href="https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware/wiki/Generic-Guides#badbt--kb">BadKB</a>, and manage custom Subghz frequencies.

- <ins><b>Misc:</b></ins> All the other options that don't fit elsewhere. Change your Flipper's name, xp level, and configure the <a href="https://github.com/Z3BRO/Flipper-Zero-RGB-Backlight">RGB backlight</a>.

<h2 align="center">Animations / Asset Packs:
  <h3 align="center">Want to try some asset packs? Check <a href="https://flipper-xtre.me/asset-packs">here</a>
  </h3>
</h2>

We created our own, new & improved Animation / Asset system, that we can finally reveal. It lets you to create and cycle through your own `Asset Packs` with only a few button presses, allowing you to easily load custom Animations and Icons like never before.

You can easily create your own pack, or find some user made ones in the discord channel. Check <a href="https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware/wiki/Asset-Packs">here</a> for a tutorial on creating your own. Essentially, we got our own <code>Anims</code> & <code>Icons</code> folders, inside each <code>Asset Pack</code>.

Once you have some packs, upload them to your Flipper in <code>SD/asset_packs</code> (if you did this right you should see <code>SD/asset_packs/PackName/Anims</code> and/or <code>SD/asset_packs/PackName/Icons</code>).

After installing the packs to Flipper, hit the <code>Arrow UP</code> button on the main menu and go to <code>Xtreme Settings</code>. Here choose which pack you want and tweak the other settings how you prefer, then press back to reboot and enjoy your new assets for all apps (e.g. Subghz scanning asset) & animations!

<h2 align="center">Bad Keyboard:</h2>

<! -- This fuckshit needs a captured image, but bc of blockage, i cant get one. someone do some magic plz -- !>
BadUSB is a wonderful app, but it lacks bluetooth capabilities. Now some might argue that its useless as you will always need authentication from both sides, but what if I told you that we found a solution to this problem?
<br><br>
Bad-KB allows you to toggle between USB and Bluetooth mode for your attacks. In Bluetooth mode it allows you to spoof the name & MAC of the device to whatever you want. Being a JBL speaker or a wireless razer keyboard is easily doable, allowing you to trick people so you can run your payloads without needing a cable at hand.

<h2 align="center">Levels:</h2>

This Firmware has 30 levels, not just the basic 3 the official one has.

With this new system in place, it allows for some cool stuff like locking animations behind a certain level. This can be done fairly easy: The idle_animations are tied to the level system. Specifically, the `Min level` variable of your manifest file is used here. Each level you reach, unlocks a new animation. The higher your level, the more animations people can see.
